                <p>The first Philadelphia Comic Convention since COVID!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>This is the first event which returned me to comics. Originally, in 2017, I had other events
                    occupying my mind.
                    How will I do on the SAT? Which colleges will I apply to? Am I going to attend prom next year? All
                    these questions
                    burdened me. Then, I practiced escapism through videogames, but something was missing.
                </p>
                <h2>Returning to an Origin</h2>
                <p>Initially, when I was visiting friends, we would game in excess.
                    Rarely did we travel or explore the local scenery around Delaware.
                    However, one day in July, we decided it was time to plan an outing.
                    Not just any outing though but one to my first comic show.</p>
                <p>
                    The location of the event, which is the same to date, is located at 76 Industrial Hwy
                    Essington, PA 19029. The building may not look like much, and the event was quite small, but it left
                    quite an impact on me. Upon entering there was a small fee of $3 but once inside the ballroom was
                    filled to the brim with numerous vendors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the event I found comics I had forgotten about: Ultimate Spider-Man (2000-2009 run), Marvel's
                    Civil War, and other miscellaneous brands. This was the beginning of a long journey through comics
                    which I continue to progress through. Without this event in my life I would of never been able
                    to discover the wonderful world of comics
                </p>
