                <p class="blog-post-meta">May 22, 2022 by <a href="#">Malachi</a></p>

                <p>The first Philadelphia Comic Convention since COVID!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>This is the first event which returned me to comics. Originally, in 2017, I had other events
                    occupying my mind.
                    How will I do on the SAT? Which colleges will I apply to? Am I going to attend prom next year? All
                    these questions
                    burdened me. Then, I practiced escapism through videogames, but something was missing.
                </p>
                <h2>Returning to an Origin</h2>
                <p>Initially, when I was visiting friends, we would game in excess.
                    Rarely did we travel or explore the local scenery around Delaware.
                    However, one day in July, we decided it was time to plan an outing.
                    Not just any outing though but one to my first comic show.</p>
                <p>
                    The location of the event, which is the same to date, is located at 76 Industrial Hwy
                    Essington, PA 19029. The building may not look like much, and the event was quite small, but it left
                    quite an impact on me. Upon entering there was a small fee of $3 but once inside the ballroom was
                    filled to the brim with numerous vendors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the event I found comics I had forgotten about: Ultimate Spider-Man (2000-2009 run), Marvel's
                    Civil War, and other miscellaneous brands. This was the beginning of a long journey through comics
                    which I continue to progress through. Without this event in my life I would of never been able
                    to discover the wonderful world of comics
                </p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Comic Collection</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">December 22, 2021 by <a href="#">Malachi</a></p>

                <p>While the size of the collection rarely matters to those who do not read comic, to collectors and
                    comic admirers alike, knowing what an individual collects can provide a large insight into who they
                    are. Personally, I collect from publishers ranging from Marvel and DC to independent companies like
                    Image, Boom Comics or Skybound.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>For reference I enjoy supporting <strong>smaller businesses</strong>, thus most of my colletion
                        is from local comic shops.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Additionally, when I refer to my collection there are more than just issues I collect. Usually, for
                    reading enjoyment I collection
                    trade paperbacks, which vary in sizes. Plus, some of the material I have collected as well ranges
                    from <em>Teen to Adult</em> in subject matter.
                </p>
                <h3>Comic Collection by Brand</h3>
                <p>Here are the top three comic series I own:</p>
                <table class="table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Publisher</th>
                            <th>Series</th>
                            <th>Issue Count</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Marvel</td>
                            <td>Ultimate Spider-Man</td>
                            <td>131</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Image Comics</td>
                            <td>Walking Dead</td>
                            <td>47</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>DC</td>
                            <td>Batman</td>
                            <td>53</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                    <tfoot>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Total Issues</td>
                            <td></td>
                            <td>231</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tfoot>
                </table>

                <p>Particually for Batman, I am collecting the <strong><em>Scott Snyder</em></strong> run of stories.
                    Walking Dead was a series I started partially because of watching the show when I was younger.
                    Finally,
                    Ultimate Spider-Man was a series I collected as a kid which I wanted to read in its entirety.</p>

                <p>Despite being a STEM based major, I also tend to dabble in art as well when working with a digital
                    medium.
                    In short, when the mood strikes I take my DSLR camera that I own and go out into the world and take
                    photos.
                    Below are some examples of my work which I took in high school.

                <p>While these works are dated I am proud to have generated moments as these and miss the process dearly of
                    creating with friends.
