PROMPT:
The creative project is entirely optional. Because it is extra credit, it cannot hurt your grade. If you submit it, it will be weighted the same as one of the annotations (10%). It will not erase and replace a grade, but rather help you by adding a 10% weighted assignment with a grade of A (assuming you don't just phone it in here!). 

This could take many forms—compose your own comic/graphic narrative, rewrite the text of a graphic narrative we’ve read together, re-imagine a graphic novel into a different genre or period, create a web-based project, etc. Your creative project needs to have two parts:

1. The creative piece

2. A brief explanation / narrative describing the choices made and their significance

In other words, if you choose to do a creative project, you will need to explain what you've made and provide evidence of the aims of the project and the way it relates to this course. This can just be 200 words or so that you submit with the creative project.

If you have any questions or need to submit the project in physical form (i.e. a comic book), please talk to me!



ANSWER:
Upon reading "Seek You" I remember the chapter regarding how we wish to be perceived. During this framework, Radtke mentions the website she created to further the point of appearances we generate for the general public.

Since I have always wanted to create a website with HTML, the barebones of the site, and CSS, the style of the page, this mainly appeals to me as loving to generate code snippets that serve a purpose. This time, the idea was to take Radtke's blog post and apply the same theory to mine. In essence, the concept of the website is to produce an "appearance" of who I am in some manner.

The homepage is just a primary webpage to act as a landing page. Originally, I was hoping to add links to local comic shops to show that comics in themselves are a respectable medium meant to be shared; however, I was not able to get the Google Map behavior quite right and have excluded it at the moment. Thus instead I have linked the shop which I visit frequently which spreads the 
love for comics as well.

The blog itself mentions a few topics: the love of comics, who I am as a collector rather than a consumer of the medium, and something one may not know about me. Additionally, there are other webcomics that I enjoy which can reveal a little about my humor as well. There is a little About section to mention the purpose of this was a real blog and random tidbits about me.

Now with all this information one can infer and shape a personality around me that may not hold true to my own. This is the purpose of the blog. An appearance is generated and perceived, filled with one's own bias perhaps, but nonetheless shaped by the barebone information I have given.

This was a delight to create - even if the final product is not perfect.
